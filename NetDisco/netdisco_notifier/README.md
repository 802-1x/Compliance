This repo is for the netdisco notifier python scripts. The script reads from a config file, gets different reports from netdisco, and sends emails depending on the notification level settings for each report.

The notifier has multiple different notification levels, which are run at different times in the crontab task scheduler: -all (sends all reports, never run by crontab) -immediate (sends important reports for things that likely require immediate action, run frequently by crontab) -historical (sends reports that we are interested in, but likely do NOT require immediate action, run infrequently by crontab) -none (this report won't get sent unless forced by the all command line option, never run by crontab)
